Mr Jetic Gu was in charge of implementing the bigram algorithm as well as
improving the score of our unigram algorithm(unknown word scoring). We are the
first team beat our improved unigram score(above original baseline)(Date 18
Sept 2016).

We each implemented our own version of unigram algorithm and contested, in the
end Jetic's won.

We didn't use git to manage the code.
