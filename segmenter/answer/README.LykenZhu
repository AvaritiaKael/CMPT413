Mr Lyken Zhu was in charge of trying out a few bigram smoothing methods to
improve our score. We are the first group to beat the original baseline(when
it was still around 90)(Date 17 Sept 2016).

We each implemented our own version of unigram algorithm and contested, in the
end Jetic's won.

However Mr Zhu was not well during the past week so we haven't gone through all of
the methods introduced in class.

We didn't use git to manage the code.
